# Int-Array

This project is an integer array object implementation. Includes the following functions. 


## Motivation 

This is my implementation of an int array object. I'm currently doing a reivew of all material previously covered at university and expanding beyond to learn more.


## Workflow

11/25: Finished writing unit tests, writing README.md file, updating inline comments for functions in .h file. Also finished 80% of functions in the .cpp file.




## Design Notes

11/25 - Eventually want to incorporate data streaming capabilities.


## Implementation Notes




## Unit Testing

To run int-array-test.cpp, we need to run the following in our console: `g++ int-array.cpp int-array-test.cpp -o int-array-test`

When writing unit tests, the goal is to use the smallest number of tests that achieve the highest meaningful coverage. We don’t want dozens of redundant or trivial tests. It's more efficient to have 10–15 well designed tests that thoroughly cover important behavior and edge cases.
